        <h3>Multi-Processor Cache Coherence Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          In this project, a cache coherence protocol was developed for a four-processor system, each equipped with a 64KB Level-1 cache and a shared memory architecture. Both snooping and directory-based coherence mechanisms were implemented to ensure a 1-cycle latency for cache coherence operations. A key aspect of the system's design was the development of an optimized Bus Arbiter, which precisely managed access to the System MemBus, improving performance and communication efficiency. The project showcased expertise in C++ programming, algorithm design, and system-level architecture, demonstrating a deep understanding of memory consistency models and processor communication.

        <h3>Estimating Vehicle Speed on Roadways Using RNNs & Transformers</h3>
        <p>
          This project focused on real-time vehicle speed estimation using deep learning techniques, particularly RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers, to process video data. The model achieved 94.25% accuracy on the VS13 dataset and 78.62% on the I24_3D dataset using LSTMs, surpassing other traditional approaches. The Transformer-based architecture demonstrated superior performance by effectively handling long-term dependencies, achieving 90% accuracy. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was minimized to 3.96 for VS13 and 10.99 for I24_3D, ensuring precise speed estimation. The system was designed to be scalable and non-intrusive, leveraging existing video surveillance infrastructure for real-world traffic monitoring applications.

        <h3>Navigating Uncertainty: Adaptive Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>
          This research-driven project explored adaptive decision-making techniques using First-Visit Monte Carlo, Semi-Gradient Temporal Difference (TD), and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The implemented models optimized resource management and goal navigation strategies, focusing on balancing reward maximization with efficient resource utilization. Policies were strategically designed to subtly guide AI decision-making, creating an illusion of efficiency while masking the true underlying objectives. The project demonstrated a strong foundation in reinforcement learning, policy optimization, and real-time decision-making under uncertainty.
